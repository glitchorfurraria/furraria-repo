THIS IS NOT A COPY OF THE TEXTURE PACK.... ISH.
(WARNING: FLASHING LIGHTS AND FURRIES EVERYWHERES.)

Also, this is a work in progress. Most textures are NOT finished, and some textures are glitchy. There is only 1 enemy and 2 bosses (one of which is a test), so just... Yeah.

This is my SECOND mod! I made some stuff. So ye. Well, this is like the texture pack, just as a mod.

Special thanks to emeM knaD for beta testing. And for being cool.


Update 0.5: Added the Wakkind and fixed the Okeeiand animation.




UPDATE 0.4: Added support for catching Gheraiis!! Also added the Okeeiand (lol sorry).



UPDATE 0.3: Added Cthulhu's Bunpup, Starlight (VERY GLITCHED ANIMATION), and alot of creatures!



UPDATE 0.2: Added Bunpup and Testing Boss (Spawn these with Cheat Sheet or HERO's mod.)
